Pirates@Home,http://pirates.spy-hill.net/,http://www.equn.com/forum/thread-9987-1-3.html,"Pirates@Home is just a test of BOINC, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing. Our current goal is to test and possibly modify the BOINC forum code for use by an unrelated (to BOINC, anyway) project called Interactions in Understanding the Universe (I2U2).",,,,,https://web.archive.org/web/,http://archive.is/
Orbit@home,http://orbit.psi.edu/,http://www.equn.com/forum/thread-7591-1-3.html,,目的是计算出天空中所有直径>6公里的陨石的精确运行轨道，完成后，再计算更小些的，比如1公里。防患于末然,,,,,
uFluids@Home,http://www.ufluids.net/,http://www.equn.com/forum/thread-10130-1-3.html,μFluids project is a massively distributed computer simulation of two-phase fluid behavior in microgravity and microfluidics problems. Our goal is to design better satellite propellant management devices and address two-phase flow in microchannel and MEMS devices. ,,,,,,

RND@home,http://arcoboinc.unex.es/rnd/,http://www.equn.com/forum/thread-16693-1-3.html,"Radio Network Design (RND) is a telecommunication problem which consists in covering a geographic area with radio signal using the fewer number of transmitters that cover the maximum area. Therefore, it is an important topic to solve nowadays, for example in the mobile wireless technology domain, mobile telephony,... Bio-inspired algorithms are a good choice to solve the RND problem, because this is an NP-hard optimization problem which fits bio-inspired algorithms very well. In this project it is used the PBIL (Population-Based Incremental Learning) algorithm. This is a modern algorithm, and we hope to get good results with it. PBIL is based on genetic algorithms and competitive learning (typical in neural networks). ",,,,,,
