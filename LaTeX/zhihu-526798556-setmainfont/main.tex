\subsection{By font name}
Fonts known to Lua\TeX\ or Xe\TeX\ may be loaded by their standard names as
you'd speak them out loud, such as \emph{Times New Roman} or
\emph{Adobe Garamond}.
`Known to' in this case generally means `exists in a standard fonts location'
such as \verb|~/Library/Fonts| on MacOSX, or \verb|C:\Windows\Fonts| on Windows.
In Lua\TeX, fonts found in the \textsc{texmf} tree can also be loaded by name.
In Xe\TeX, fonts found in the \textsc{texmf} tree can be loaded in Windows and Linux,
but not on MacOSX.


\subsection{By file name}
Xe\TeX\ and Lua\TeX\ also allow fonts to be loaded by file name instead of font name.
When you have a very large collection of fonts, you will sometimes not
wish to have them all installed in your system's font directories.
In this case, it is more convenient to load them from a different location on your disk.
This technique is also necessary in Xe\TeX\ when loading OpenType fonts that are present within your \TeX\ distribution, such as \verb|/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public|.
Fonts in such locations are visible to Xe\TeX\ but cannot be loaded by font name, only file name; Lua\TeX\ does not have this restriction.
